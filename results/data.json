However, there is a strategy that can maximize the expected return.\n\nThe expected return is the sum of the products of the probability of each outcome and the payout for that outcome. Since there are six possible outcomes, each with a probability of 1/6, the expected return is:\n\n(1/6) x (1 + bet) + (1/6) x (2 + bet) + (1/6) x (3 + bet) + (1/6) x (4 + bet) + (1/6) x (5 + bet) + (1/6) x (6 + bet)\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n(1/6) x (21 + 6bet)\n\nTherefore, the strategy that maximizes the expected return is to always predict the number 6. This is because the payout for predicting 6 is the highest, at 7 times the original bet, and the probability of rolling a 6 is the same as any other number, at 1/6. So, the expected return for this strategy is:\n\n(1/6) x (21 + 6bet) = (1/6) x 21 + (1/6) x 6bet = 3.5 + bet\n\nThis means that, on average, the player can expect to earn 3.5 times their original bet by always predicting 6.

This means that for every hour, we are only making a net progress of 1 meter (3 meters up minus 2 meters down). \n\nTherefore, it will take us 30 hours to climb the full 30 meters to the top of the well, as we can only climb 1 meter per hour. \n\nHowever, we need to remember that we slide down 2 meters immediately after climbing 3 meters. This means that we need to subtract 2 meters from our total distance climbed after every cycle of climbing and sliding. \n\nSo after the first hour, we will have climbed 1 meter and have 29 meters left to climb. After the second hour, we will have climbed another meter (for a total of 2 meters climbed) but will have 27 meters left to climb (due to the 2-meter slide). \n\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that after every cycle of climbing and sliding, we are effectively reducing the total distance we need to climb by 1 meter. \n\nSince we need to climb a total of 30 meters, we will have to go through 28 cycles of climbing and sliding (since we reduce the total distance by 1 meter after each cycle). \n\nTherefore, it will take us 28 hours to escape from the well."
